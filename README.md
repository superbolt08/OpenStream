## üöÄ Application of the Project

The PiEdge Cloud platform addresses several practical use cases by leveraging a low-cost, scalable Raspberry Pi cluster. Key applications include:

- **Real-Time Video Streaming:**  
  Deliver live video feeds for remote monitoring, educational or entertainment broadcasts, and public safety applications with minimal latency.

- **Edge Computing:**  
  Process data closer to its source to reduce latency and improve responsiveness in IoT deployments, smart surveillance, and emergency response systems.

- **Distributed Machine Learning:**  
  Enable real-time object detection, face recognition, and data analysis by distributing machine learning tasks across multiple nodes.

- **Cost-Effective Cloud Alternatives:**  
  Provide a budget-friendly cloud platform for small businesses, educational institutions, and research organizations unable to afford traditional data centers.

- **Scalable Research & Development:**  
  Offer a modular environment for prototyping and testing new algorithms in distributed computing, video processing, and real-time analytics.
