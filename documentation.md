1. Project Overview
Frontend: Built using Next.js, with React components and TypeScript for type safety.
Backend: Includes a WebSocket server for real-time communication and a REST API for user management.
Database: Uses MongoDB as the database, with Prisma as the ORM.
Deployment: Configured for Kubernetes and Docker, with YAML files for Kubernetes resources and Dockerfiles for containerization.
2. Key Features
Real-Time Chat:

Implemented using WebSocket (websocket/app.js and index.js).
Frontend chat interface in app/(pages)/chat/page.tsx.
User Management:

REST API for creating users in route.ts.
Prisma ORM for database interactions in index.ts.
Streaming:

Prisma schema includes a Stream model for managing streams and associated chats in schema.prisma.
Environment Configuration:

.env files for development and test environments.
ConfigMap in Kubernetes for environment variables (env-development-configmap.yaml).
3. Infrastructure
Docker:

Dockerfiles for the server and WebSocket services.
docker-compose.yaml for local development with services for the server, WebSocket, MongoDB, and Mongo Express.
Kubernetes:

Deployment and service YAML files for MongoDB, Mongo Express, WebSocket, and the server.
PersistentVolumeClaims for data persistence.
Health Checks:

Configured in Kubernetes YAML files and WebSocket server (/health endpoint).
4. Code Quality
Frontend:

Uses CSS modules for styling.
Implements a SocketProvider for managing WebSocket connections.
Backend:

Prisma ORM is used for database interactions, ensuring type safety.
Error handling is implemented in API routes.
Linting:

ESLint is configured with Next.js and TypeScript support.
5. Potential Improvements
Error Handling:

Improve error messages in the WebSocket server and API routes.
Security:

Sensitive environment variables (e.g., database credentials) should be encrypted or managed securely.
Scalability:

Add horizontal scaling configurations for Kubernetes deployments.
Testing:

Add unit and integration tests for both frontend and backend.
6. Deployment
Local Development:

Use docker-compose.yaml to spin up the services locally.
Commands like npm run dev for frontend development.
Production:

Kubernetes YAML files are ready for deployment in a cluster.
Includes a NetworkPolicy for securing communication between pods.
This project is well-structured and uses modern tools and frameworks, making it suitable for real-time applications like live streaming and chat.
